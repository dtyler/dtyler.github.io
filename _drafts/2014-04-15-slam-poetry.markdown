I've spent quite awhile over the past few weeks watching clips on youtube, specifically spoken word poetry. Now before you imagine me watching hours of performances you remember from your high school English classes, watch some of these videos:

* http://www.ted.com/talks/sarah_kay_if_i_should_have_a_daughter.html
* SlamNation: Taylor Mali - "What Teachers Make"
* Sarah Kay & Phil Kaye "An Origin Story"
* Taylor Mali - Totally like whatever, you know on Def Jam Poetry
