# So here's a question of mine: #

Why is it that what I want to do now and what I will wish I done in this time 
when looking back so different?

Obviously this is always true, but on lazy weekends when trying to be 
productive this came across my mind and seems like as good a place as any to 
start scratching down my thoughts to share with the internet.

I just did a search along these lines: `"current desires vs long term needs"` and
not surprisingly ended up with sites offering to help with my love life than my
motivations.
